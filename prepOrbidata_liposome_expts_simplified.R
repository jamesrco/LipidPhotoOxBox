# Some notes:
#
#  1. If using massifquant or centWave and you are sure your input data are centroided, can ignore warning message "It looks like this file is in profile mode. [method] can process only centroid mode data !" since this is just based on a heuristic. That is, you can ignore the message if you are certain data are in centroid mode. You can verify this by opening one of your converted .mzXML files in a text reader. You should see: <dataProcessing centroided="1"></dataProcessing> (a "0" is bad)
# 
#     For more on this error, see http://metabolomics-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=267 or https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/xcms/xybDDQTaQiY
#
#  2. So long as the number of peak data insertion problems is relatively low (i.e., < 100), you can safely ignore the error. Otherwise, might try lowering the ppm
#
#  3. On-the-fly plotting features (i.e., with sleep â‰¥ 0.001 enabled) don't appear to function properly in Mac RStudio
