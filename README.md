This repository contains code and data for:

[Collins, J. R., H. F. Fredricks, J. S. Bowman, C. P. Ward, C. Moreno, K. Longnecker, A. Marchetti, C. M. Hansel, H. W. Ducklow, and B. A. S. Van Mooy. 2018. The molecular products and biogeochemical significance of lipid photooxidation in West Antarctic surface waters. *Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta*; doi:10.1016/j.gca.2018.04.030](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2018.04.030)

A much earlier version of the same work also appeared as Chapter 4 of [my dissertation](https://doi.org/10.1575/1912/8721). Additional code in this repository was used for Appendix B of my dissertation.

The only data necessary for full recreation of the results that do not appear in this reposistory (due to their large size) are the original (.raw) and .mzXML mass spectrometer data files. I am working to provide these in permanent home on the Internet. In the meantime, please email me and I'm happy to provide a Dropbox link for direct download.

The processed HPLC-MS data objects and output (in .csv format) are available at https://github.com/jamesrco/LipidPhotoOxBox/tree/master/data/nice/Orbi_MS_data and https://github.com/jamesrco/LipidPhotoOxBox/tree/master/data/nice/LOBSTAHS_lipid_identities, respectively.
