This repository contains code and data to support Collins et al., *The diverse products and biogeochemical significance of lipid photooxidation in coastal surface waters of West Antarctica*. A version of the manuscript also appeared as Chapter 4 of [my dissertation](http://dx.doi.org/10.1575/1912/8721). Additional code in this repository was used for Appendix B of my dissertation.

The only data necessary for full recreation of the results that do not appear in this reposistory (due to their large size) are the original (.raw) and .mzXML mass spectrometer data files. I am working to provide these in permanent home on the Internet. In the meantime, please email me and I'm happy to provide a Dropbox link for direct download.

The processed HPLC-MS data objects and output (in .csv format) are available at https://github.com/jamesrco/LipidPhotoOxBox/tree/master/data/nice/Orbi_MS_data and https://github.com/jamesrco/LipidPhotoOxBox/tree/master/data/nice/LOBSTAHS_lipid_identities, respectively.
